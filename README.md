# Audience Rating Prediction

This project demonstrates the process of building a machine learning model to predict 'audience_rating' using a given dataset. The project includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and validation for accuracy, all presented in a well-documented Jupyter Notebook.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to:
1. **Build a pipeline** for predicting 'audience_rating' from the given dataset.
2. Demonstrate the pipeline's working through a detailed notebook.
3. Validate the model's accuracy using appropriate metrics.

## Features
- End-to-end machine learning pipeline.
- Comprehensive data preprocessing (handling missing values, feature selection, encoding, etc.).
- Model training and hyperparameter tuning.
- Model evaluation and validation.
- Clear visualization of results.

## Dataset
The dataset contains features relevant to predicting the 'audience_rating'. Details of the dataset and its features are included in the notebook.

## Requirements
To run this project, the following libraries are required:

- Python 3.8+
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Google Colab

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-folder>
   ```

2. Open the Google Colab notebook:
   - Upload the provided `.ipynb` file to your Google Drive.
   - Open Google Colab and load the notebook from your Drive.

3. Ensure all dependencies are installed by running the first cell in the notebook.

4. Follow the instructions in the notebook to execute the pipeline and validate the model.

## Model Validation
The model's performance is validated using:
- **Accuracy Score**: Measures the overall correctness of the predictions.
- **Confusion Matrix**: Evaluates the performance of classification models.
- **R-Squared/Mean Absolute Error**: For regression tasks, these metrics assess model accuracy.

## Results
- Summary of the model's performance is provided in the notebook with visualizations and metrics.
